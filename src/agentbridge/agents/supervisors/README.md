# ü§ñ Supervisors (Delegator & Orchestrator)

The **Supervisors module** contains the two central agents that oversee all other agents in **AgentBridge**:

- **Delegator** ‚Üí Acts as the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) host**, managing agent registration, state, and routing. It powers the web GUI and exposes APIs for conversations, tasks, and agent management.  
- **Orchestrator** ‚Üí A **LangGraph-based planner** that takes high-level user goals, generates structured step-by-step plans, and coordinates worker agents to execute them.

Together, they form the **control layer** of AgentBridge.
