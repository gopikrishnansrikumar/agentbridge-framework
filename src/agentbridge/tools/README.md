# üõ†Ô∏è Tools (MCP Server & Utilities)

The **Tools module** provides the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** and supporting utilities used by worker agents in AgentBridge.  
These tools expose file I/O, validation, debugging, and spawning functions that agents can call at runtime.  

Key responsibilities:
- Run the MCP server over **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.  
- Expose APIs for reading, writing, and updating robot description files (MJCF, SDF, URDF).  
- Validate robot models and debug them in simulation.  
- Retrieve few-shot examples from pre-loaded vector databases (RAG).  
- Provide machine feedback and spawner scripts for testing.  
- Host unit tests to ensure consistent format handling.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

- **mcp_server.py** ‚Üí Main FastMCP server implementation.  
  - Provides endpoints for agents to discover and invoke tools dynamically.  
- **utils/** ‚Üí Supporting utilities:  
  - `agent_tools.py` ‚Üí File readers/writers, validation, and debugging functions.  
  - `machine_feedback.py` ‚Üí Interprets simulator responses and passes them to agents.  
  - `spawner_scripts.py` ‚Üí Scripts to spawn/test models in Gazebo.  
  - `unit_tests_MJCF.py` ‚Üí Unit tests for MJCF parsing/validation.  
  - `unit_tests_SDF.py` ‚Üí Unit tests for SDF parsing/validation.  
  - `unit_tests_URDF.py` ‚Üí Unit tests for URDF parsing/validation.

## üöÄ Running the MCP Server

From the project root:

```bash
uv run agentbridge
```

Or from inside the folder:

```bash
uv run mcp_server.py
```

The MCP server will be available at:  
üëâ **http://localhost:8000/sse**  

‚ö†Ô∏è If port **8000** is busy, it may shift to **8001** automatically.  

Worker agents will detect the MCP server and can access the tools listed.

## üõ† Development Notes

- Tools are dynamically discovered by worker agents via MCP.  
- Unit tests for each file type can be run individually:  

```bash
uv run utils/unit_tests_MJCF.py
uv run utils/unit_tests_SDF.py
uv run utils/unit_tests_URDF.py
```  

- Machine feedback is parsed from Gazebo and provided back to debugging agents.  
- The **spawner scripts** automate launching robot models for validation in simulation.

## ‚úÖ Checklist Before Running

1. Ensure `.env` has required API keys.  
2. Run MCP server (`uv run mcp_server.py`).  
3. Start worker agents ‚Äî they will auto-discover MCP tools.  
4. Verify in the GUI (`Tools` tab) that MCP tools are registered.
